# Table Joins – Theory Notes

## Difference between Cartesian Product and Outer Join

### Cartesian Product (CROSS JOIN)

Cartesian product means **combining every row of one table with every row of another table**.

* It does **not require any join condition**
* All possible combinations of rows are returned
* If Table A has 3 rows and Table B has 4 rows, the result will have **12 rows**
* It is rarely used in real applications
* Sometimes happens by mistake when a JOIN condition is missing

### Outer Join

Outer join is used to **join related data from two tables** and also **include rows that do not match**.

Types of outer joins:

* **LEFT OUTER JOIN** – returns all rows from the left table

* **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** – returns all rows from the right table

* **FULL OUTER JOIN** – returns all rows from both tables

* A join condition is required

* Unmatched rows contain `NULL` values

* Very commonly used in real-world queries

### Key Differences

| Cartesian Product          | Outer Join              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| No join condition required | Join condition required |
| Returns all combinations   | Returns matched data    |
| Result size is very large  | Result is meaningful    |
| Rarely used                | Frequently used         |
